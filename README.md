- [Visual-Inertial SLAM](https://github.com/jvolheim3/Visual-Inertial-SLAM)   
  This project utilizes camera/IMU data to compute landmarks in a video feed and optimize     
  the location and mapping of the robot over time.

- [LiDAR-Based SLAM](https://github.com/jvolheim3/Lidar-based-slam) :star:  
  This project utilizes lidar, IMU and camera data to compute occupancy grids, localization and mapping of the traversed environment.
  
- [Orientation Tracking](https://github.com/jvolheim3/Orientation_Tracking)   
    This project utilizes IMU data to track the orientation of the robot over time and reconstruct visual data into a panoramic image of the environment.
