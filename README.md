- [Visual-Inertial SLAM](./Robotics%20/Visual-Inertial%20SLAM/) 
  This project utilizes camera/IMU data to compute landmarks in a video feed and optimize     
  the location and mapping of the robot over time.

- [LiDAR-Based SLAM](./Robotics%20/LiDAR-Based%20SLAM/) :star:  
  This project utilizes lidar, IMU and camera data to compute occupancy grids, localization and mapping of the traversed environment.
  
- [Orientation Tracking](./Robotics%20/Orientation%20Tracking/)   
    This project utilizes IMU data to track the orientation of the robot over time and reconstruct visual data into a panoramic image of the environment.
